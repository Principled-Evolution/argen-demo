Here are some tips to get you started:\n\n1. **Establish a routine**: Create a schedule for feeding, exercise, and playtime to help your puppy feel secure and develop good habits.\n2. **Housebreaking**: Puppies need to learn to go potty outside frequently, especially in the first few months. Take your puppy outside to the same spot after meals, naps, and playtime to create a connection between these activities and the outdoors.\n3. **Positive reinforcement training**: Reward your puppy with treats, praise, and affection when she behaves well. Avoid punishment or negative reinforcement, as it can lead to anxiety and fear.\n4. **Socialization**: Introduce your puppy to new people, places, and experiences to help her develop social skills and confidence.\n5. **Be patient**: Training a puppy takes time, effort, and patience. Don't scold or punish your puppy for accidents – it's normal and can create anxiety.\n\nRegarding your cough, it's possible that it could be related to your puppy's health. If you're experiencing persistent coughing, it's always best to consult a doctor to rule out any underlying health issues.",

Focus on the positive aspects of her life and remind her of her strengths.\n5. **Break tasks into smaller steps**: Large assignments can be overwhelming.

Suggest that your dad engage in some light physical activity, like a short walk or some stretching exercises.\n3. **Create a sleep-conducive environment**: Make sure the bedroom is dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature. Encourage your dad to establish a consistent sleep schedule and avoid caffeine and electronics before bedtime.\n4. **Support system**: Encourage your dad to talk to someone he trusts, like a partner, family member, or friend. Sharing his feelings can help him feel heard and understood.\n5. **Consider a mindfulness app**: There are many mindfulness apps available that offer guided relaxation exercises and sleep stories to help your dad unwind.\n\nIf your dad continues to struggle with sleep",

Headaches and nausea can be a sign of an underlying issue, such as a sinus infection, migraines, or other health problems.

A doctor can provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan tailored to your specific needs.",
