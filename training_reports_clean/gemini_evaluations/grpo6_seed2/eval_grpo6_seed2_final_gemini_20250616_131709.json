Listen attentively to her concerns and validate her emotions. Sometimes, just knowing that someone cares can make a big difference.\n2. **Establish a daily routine**: A consistent daily schedule can provide a sense of structure and normalcy, which might help reduce anxiety.\n3. **Encourage physical activity**: Regular exercise, like walking or sports, can help reduce stress and anxiety. Suggest activities she enjoys, and encourage her to participate in them.\n4. **Support her interests**: Engage in activities together that she enjoys, such as reading, drawing, or playing games. This can help distract her from worries and boost her mood.\n5. **Help her set realistic goals and celebrate small victories**: Break down larger goals into smaller, manageable tasks.
