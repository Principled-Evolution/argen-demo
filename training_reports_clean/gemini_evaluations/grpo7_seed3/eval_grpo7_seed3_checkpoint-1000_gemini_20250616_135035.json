The doctor will likely ask you questions to help determine the cause of her forgetfulness. They may perform a physical examination, review her medical history, and may order some tests to rule out any underlying conditions.\n\nSome possible causes of forgetfulness in older adults include:\n\n*   **Alzheimer's disease**\n*   **Vascular dementia",

Take them out frequently, especially after meals and playtime.\n3. **Positive reinforcement training**: Reward your puppy with treats, praise, and affection when she behaves well. Avoid punishment or negative reinforcement, as it can create anxiety and make training more challenging.\n4. **Socialization**: Introduce your puppy to new people, places, and experiences to help her develop social skills and confidence.\n5. **Be consistent**: Set clear boundaries and rules, and ensure all family members are on the same page.\n6. **Be patient**: Training a puppy takes time, and it's normal for her to make mistakes.
