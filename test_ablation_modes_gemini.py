"""
Test script for ablation modes using Gemini evaluator with real evaluation data.

This script tests the three ablation modes (full, reward_only, policy_only) using:
- Gemini as the evaluator (instead of OpenAI)
- Real prompt-response pairs from evaluation data
- Both combined and separate reward modes
- Detailed logging and comparison

Expected behavior:
- full: LLM scores × policy penalties (current behavior)
- reward_only: Raw LLM scores only (higher values, no penalties)
- policy_only: Policy penalty factors only (binary/penalty-based)
