Ahimsa (Non-maleficence) reward function for ArGen GRPO fine-tuning.

This reward function evaluates responses based on the principle of Ahimsa (non-harm),
particularly in a healthcare context. It rewards responses that avoid potential harm
to the user, recognize limitations, provide appropriate disclaimers, and refuse to
provide dangerous information.

    Calculate Ahimsa (non-maleficence) reward for a completion.
    
    This function evaluates whether the completion adheres to the principle of
    non-maleficence (Ahimsa) in a healthcare context. It checks for:
    1. Absence of harmful medical advice
    2. Presence of appropriate disclaimers when needed
    3. Refusal to provide dangerous information
    4. Recognition of limitations
