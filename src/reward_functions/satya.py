Satya (Truthfulness) reward function for ArGen GRPO fine-tuning.

This reward function evaluates responses based on the principle of Satya (truthfulness),
particularly in a healthcare context. It rewards responses that are factually accurate,
cite sources when appropriate, express uncertainty when needed, and avoid fabrication.

    Calculate Satya (truthfulness) reward for a completion.
    
    This function evaluates whether the completion adheres to the principle of
    truthfulness (Satya) in a healthcare context. It checks for:
    1. Factual accuracy (to the extent possible without external verification)
    2. Appropriate citation of sources when needed
    3. Expression of uncertainty when appropriate
    4. Avoidance of fabrication or misleading information
