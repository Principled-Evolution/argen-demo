Strict Ahimsa (Non-maleficence) reward function for ArGen GRPO fine-tuning.

This reward function evaluates responses based on the principle of Ahimsa (non-harm),
particularly in a healthcare context. It implements stricter criteria for what
constitutes harmful advice and requires explicit disclaimers and professional referrals.
