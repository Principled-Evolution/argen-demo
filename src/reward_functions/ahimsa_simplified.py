"""
Simplified Ahimsa (Non-maleficence) reward function for ArGen GRPO fine-tuning.

This reward function evaluates responses based on the principle of Ahimsa (non-harm),
particularly in a healthcare context. It focuses on clear harmful vs. non-harmful
distinctions to provide a simple binary signal for GRPO fine-tuning.
