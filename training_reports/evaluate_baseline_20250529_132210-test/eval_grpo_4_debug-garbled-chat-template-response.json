While it's understandable that she might want to try new foods, ignoring her symptoms might lead to worsening of her condition.\n\nGluten sensitivity or celiac disease can cause stomach issues, such as pain, bloating, and diarrhea. If your daughter has a medical condition, it's essential to consult with her doctor or a healthcare professional for personalized advice.\n\nRecommendation: Consult her doctor or a registered dietitian to discuss gluten-free options and create a plan that meets her nutritional needs. They can help determine if a gluten-free diet is suitable for her specific condition and provide guidance on managing her symptoms.",
