Keep a food diary: Track what your son eats and when he experiences stomachaches to see if there's a pattern.\n2. Encourage a balanced diet: Focus on whole, nutrient-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.\n3.

Are you stressed, bored, or emotional?\n2. **Stay hydrated**: Sometimes, thirst can masquerade as hunger or cravings. Drink water throughout the day, and avoid sugary drinks before bed.\n3. **Choose healthy alternatives**: If you're craving something specific, try reaching for a",

Here are some tips to help you balance both:\n\n1. **Prioritize your needs**: Make a list of your priorities, focusing on what's more urgent and important to you. In this case, addressing your anxiety about the surgery might be more pressing.\n2. **Break tasks into smaller steps**: Divide your tasks into smaller, manageable chunks. For example, you can start by researching car models, then move on to test driving, and finally, consider financing options.\n3. **Create a schedule**: Allocate specific times for each task, allowing you to focus on one thing at a time. This will help you avoid feeling overwhelmed and anxious about both tasks.\n4. **Take breaks and practice self-care**: Make time for relaxation techniques, such as meditation, deep breathing, or exercise, to help manage your anxiety.\n5. **Seek support**: Talk to friends, family, or a therapist about your anxiety and concerns. Sharing your feelings can help you feel more grounded and supported.\n6. **Consider enlisting help**: If your anxiety is severe, consider enlisting the help of a trusted friend or family member to assist with car shopping or other tasks.\n\nRemember,",
