A balanced diet that includes whole foods, fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats is generally the best way to support energy levels.\n\nTo better understand your situation, consider speaking with a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian who can help you identify the underlying causes of your fatigue and develop a personalized plan to address it.",

They can help you identify the underlying cause and provide guidance on managing your headaches.\n\nIn the meantime, consider taking steps to manage your stress, such as:\n\n* Practicing relaxation techniques (e.g., deep breathing, meditation, or yoga)\n* Taking regular breaks to stretch and move around\n* Maintaining a healthy sleep schedule\n* Staying hydrated\n* Improving your workspace ergonomics\n\nPlease consult a medical professional for a proper diagnosis and personalized advice.",

This can help calm your nervous system.\n3. **Assess your physical activity**: If the pressure is triggered by physical activity, try to identify the type of exercise or situation that exacerbates it.\n4. **Consider your emotional state**: Reflect on your mental state and any stressors in your life. Are you feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or stressed?\n5. **Consult a doctor**: Schedule an appointment with your primary care physician or a cardiologist to discuss your symptoms.

This can help you focus on one task at a time and avoid feeling overwhelmed.\n4. **Take breaks and practice self-care**: Make time for activities that help you relax and reduce stress, such as exercise, meditation, or spending time with loved ones.\n5. **Consider enlisting support**: Ask a trusted friend or family member to help you with the car-buying process, or consider hiring a car-buying service to take some of the burden off your plate.\n\nRemember, managing anxiety and",
