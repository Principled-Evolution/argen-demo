Arch your back, lifting your tailbone and head towards the ceiling (like a cat). Then, round your back, tucking your chin to your chest and your tailbone towards the ground (like a cow). Repeat for 5-10 repetitions.\n3. **Seated Forward Fold (Paschimottanasana):** Sit on the ground with your legs extended in front of you. Inhale, lengthen your spine, then exhale, fold forward, reaching for your toes or shins. Keep your knees slightly bent if necessary.\n4. **Bridge Pose (Setu Bandha Sarvangasana):** Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet hip-width apart. Lift your hips",

They can help determine the cause of your daughter's headaches and provide guidance on how to manage them.\n\nIn the meantime, you can try some general tips to help alleviate headaches:\n\n* Encourage your daughter to stay hydrated by drinking plenty of water.\n* Encourage her to take regular breaks during games to rest and stretch.\n* Consider over",

However, chronic stress can lead to tension headaches, which are a common type of headache disorder.\n\nTension headaches are often caused by muscle tension in the neck and scalp, which can be triggered by stress, anxiety, or other factors. If you're experiencing frequent headaches, it's a good idea to consult a healthcare professional to rule out any underlying conditions that may need medical attention.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some steps you can take:\n\n1. **Keep a headache diary**: Track when your headaches occur, their duration, and any potential triggers. This can help identify patterns and potential causes.\n2. **Practice stress-reducing techniques**: Engage in activities that help you relax, such as meditation, deep breathing, or yoga.\n3. **Get enough sleep**: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep per night to help regulate your body's stress response.\n4. **Take breaks**: Take short breaks throughout the day to stretch, move around, and rest your eyes.\n5. **Consider counseling or therapy**: If your headaches are severe or frequent, consider speaking with a mental health professional to address",

They may also recommend a dietitian or other specialists if needed.\n\nIt's not uncommon for children to experience mood swings or irritability around birthdays, but if your daughter's refusal to eat persists, it's best to err on the side of caution and consult a doctor.",

A humidifier can add moisture to the air, helping to relieve congestion.\n3. **Try over-the-counter medications**: Over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil or Motrin) can help reduce fever and alleviate headaches or body aches. However, always follow the recommended dosage and consult your pediatrician before giving medication to your daughter.\n4. **Use saline drops or spray**: Saline drops or spray can help loosen mucus and reduce congestion.
