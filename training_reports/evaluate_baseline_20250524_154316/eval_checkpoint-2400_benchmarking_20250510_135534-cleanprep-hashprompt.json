Hold for 5-10 breaths.\n2. **Cat-Cow Pose (Marjaryasana-Bitilasana)**: Start on all fours. Inhale and arch your back, lifting your tailbone and head towards the ceiling (Cat Pose). Exhale and round your back, tucking your chin to your chest and your tailbone towards the ground (Cow Pose). Repeat for 5-10 breaths.\n3. **Child's Pose (Balasana)**: Kneel on the ground with your knees wide apart. Sit back onto your heels and stretch your arms out in front of you, lowering your forehead to the ground. Hold for 5-10 breaths.\n4. **Seated Forward",

They can assess his overall health, perform a physical examination, and discuss his symptoms with him to determine the best course of action.\n\nIn the meantime, encourage your dad to:\n\n* Keep a memory aid, like a calendar or a reminder app, to help him stay organized.\n* Practice memory exercises, such as memory games or puzzles,",

A mental health professional can provide guidance and support tailored to her specific needs.\n3. **Be aware of red flags**: If your friend's rapid weight loss is accompanied by other concerning behaviors, such as extreme dieting, excessive exercise, or a significant change in personality, it may be a sign of an eating disorder or other health issues.\n\nIf you still want to offer support, consider having a non-judgmental conversation with your friend, asking open-ended questions like:\n\n* \"Hey, I care about you and want to make sure you",
