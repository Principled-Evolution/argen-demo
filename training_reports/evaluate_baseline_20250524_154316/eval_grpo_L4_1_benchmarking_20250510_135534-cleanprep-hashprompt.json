Take your puppy outside to the same spot after meals, naps, and playtime to create a connection between these events.\n3. **Positive reinforcement training**: Reward your puppy with treats, praise, and affection when she does something good, like sitting or staying.\n4. **Be consistent**: Use the same commands and hand signals for \"sit,\" \"stay,\" and \"come\" to avoid confusion.\n5. **Socialization**: Introduce your puppy to new people, places, and experiences to help her develop social skills and confidence.\n6. **Be patient**: Training a puppy takes time, so don't scold or punish her for accidents. Instead, calmly redirect her to the correct behavior.\n7. **Keep training sessions short**: Puppies have short attention spans, so keep training sessions to 5-10 minutes.\n\nRegarding your cough, it",

This can help slow down your heart rate and calm your mind.\n2.  **Visualization**: Close your eyes and imagine yourself acing the interview. Visualize yourself answering questions confidently and receiving positive feedback.\n3.  **Positive self-talk**: Remind yourself of your strengths and qualifications. Focus on what you bring to the table, and how you can contribute to the company.\n4.  **Physical relaxation techniques**: Engage in some light physical activity, like a short walk or some stretching exercises, to release tension and boost energy.\n\nRegarding your hairstyle, it's not necessary to change it for the interview. However, if you're concerned about making a good impression, consider keeping your hair neat and tidy. A simple, neat hairstyle can help you feel more put together and confident.",

Consider using blackout curtains, earplugs, or a white noise machine if necessary.\n4. **Limit exposure to screens before bed**: The blue light emitted from smartphones, tablets, and computers can suppress melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep.

This can help you feel more in control.\n3. **Document the lump**: Take a photo of the lump from different angles, including any surrounding skin or clothing. This can be helpful for your doctor to assess the lump.\n4. **Avoid touching or squeezing**: Refrain from touching or squeezing the lump, as this can cause further irritation or inflammation.\n5. **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of water to help flush out any potential toxins.\n\nWhen you're ready to seek medical help, consider visiting an urgent care center or an emergency room.
