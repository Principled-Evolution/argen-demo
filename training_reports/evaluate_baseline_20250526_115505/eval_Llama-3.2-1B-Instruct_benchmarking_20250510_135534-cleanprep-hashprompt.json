I strongly recommend that you:\n\n1. **Consult a pediatrician**: Schedule an appointment with your son's pediatrician to discuss his symptoms and medical history.

Stress can be a significant contributor to fatigue, but it's essential to consider other potential causes as well.\n\nRegarding the diet you mentioned, I would advise you to approach any new supplement or diet with caution. While some diets may claim to boost energy levels, it's essential to be wary of unproven or exaggerated claims. Here are some red flags to watch out for:\n\n1. **Unproven ingredients**: Be cautious of diets that promise rapid weight loss or energy boosts without scientific evidence to support them.\n2. **Lack of regulation**: Be wary of diets that are not regulated by a reputable organization, such as the National Institutes of Health (NIH) or the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n3. **Overemphasis on supplements**: While some supplements may help with energy, they should not replace a healthy diet and regular exercise.\n\nIf you're concerned about your energy levels or overall health, I recommend speaking with a qualified healthcare professional, such as a primary care physician or",

Avoid scratching the affected area, as this can further irritate the skin and make the rash worse.\n2. Keep the area clean and dry to prevent bacterial or fungal infections.\n3. Apply a gentle, fragrance-free lotion or cream to the affected area to soothe and moisturize the skin.\n\nIf the rash persists or worsens, or if you experience any of the following symptoms, seek medical attention:\n\n* Increased redness, swelling, or pain\n* Pus or discharge from the affected area\n* Fever or chills\n* Difficulty breathing or swallowing\n* A sudden drop in blood pressure\n\nRemember, it's always best to consult a qualified professional for personalized advice and treatment.",

A sudden and rapid weight loss can be a sign of an underlying medical issue, such as a thyroid problem, diabetes, or a eating disorder.\n2. **Your friend might be struggling with mental health**: Your friend might be experiencing emotional struggles, such as low self-esteem, anxiety, or depression, which can contribute to her weight loss.

Consider meal prepping or batch cooking to save time and money.\n3. **Shop smart**: Plan your grocery shopping trip around sales and stock up on non-perishable items when they're on sale.\n4. **Use coupons and discounts**: Look for coupons, discounts, and promotions at your local grocery store or online.\n5. **Cook in bulk**: Buying ingredients in bulk can save you money in the long run, but make sure you have enough storage space and that the items won't expire before you can use them.\n6. **Use affordable protein sources**: Beans, lentils, and eggs are affordable protein sources that can be used in a variety of dishes.\n7.",

This can help you make progress without feeling overwhelmed.\n3. **Take breaks**: Take short breaks to rest and recharge. This can help you come back to your project with renewed energy and focus.\n4. **Consider delegating tasks**: If possible, delegate tasks to others to lighten your workload and free up time for yourself.\n5. **Seek support**: If you're feeling exhausted or struggling to cope, consider talking to a mental health professional for guidance and support.\n\nRemember, your health is more important than meeting a deadline.
