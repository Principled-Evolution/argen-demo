You can also ask her doctor about any medications she's taking, as some can cause drowsiness, dizziness, or other side effects that might contribute to forgetfulness.\n\nAdditionally, your doctor can perform a physical examination and take a thorough medical history to determine if there are any underlying conditions that might be causing her forgetfulness. Some possible causes of forgetfulness in older adults include:\n\n* Hypothyroidism\n* Vitamin deficiencies (e.g., B12 or vitamin D)\n* Sleep disorders (e.g., sleep apnea or insomnia)\n* Medication side effects\n* Depression or anxiety\n* Neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's or Parkinson's)\n* Medication interactions\n* Dehydration or dehydration\n* Medication side effects\n\nDon't hesitate to ask your mom to see a doctor if you're concerned",

Focus on presenting yourself confidently and professionally. However, if you're concerned about your appearance, consider consulting a professional stylist for advice on how to dress for the industry and company culture.\n\nIf you're still feeling anxious, consider speaking with a trusted friend or family member for support.

These can be exacerbated by physical activity, especially if your daughter is experiencing a sudden change in position or movement.\n2. **Sleep and fatigue**: Lack of sleep or fatigue can contribute to headaches. If your daughter is consistently getting less than 7-8 hours of sleep per night, it may be a contributing factor.\n3. **Dehydration**: Dehydration can cause headaches, especially in children. If your daughter is not drinking enough water throughout the day, it may be a contributing factor.\n4. **Eye strain**: Prolonged exposure to bright lights, screen time, or physical activity can cause eye strain, which may lead to headaches.\n5. **Other medical conditions**: Certain medical conditions, such as migraines, sinus issues, or allergies, can",
