A persistent cough can be caused by a variety of factors, including allergies, infections, and even environmental factors. Here are some possible causes and suggestions:\n\n*   **Allergies:** If you have allergies, it's possible that your body is reacting to something in your environment, such as pollen, dust, or mold. Try to identify the allergen and see if it's the cause of your cough.\n*   **Infections:** If you have a viral or bacterial infection, it's possible that your cough is a symptom of that infection. If you're experiencing a persistent cough, it's a good idea to consult a doctor to rule out any underlying conditions that may need medical attention.\n*   **Environmental factors:** Exposure to smoke, pollution, or other environmental toxins can also cause a persistent cough. If you work in an office or live in an area with high levels of pollution, it's worth considering switching to a different phone plan that may have better air quality.\n\nTo manage your cough, you can try the following:\n\n*   **Stay hydrated:** Drink plenty of water to help thin out mucus and soothe your throat.\n*   **Use a humidifier:** Adding moisture to the air can help relieve congestion and coughing.\n*   **Rest:** Get plenty of rest to help your body recover from the underlying cause of your cough.\n\n**Switching phone plan:**\n\nIf you're concerned about your phone plan, here are some factors to consider:\n\n*   **Coverage:** Look for a plan with good coverage in your area, especially if you live in an area with limited coverage.\n*   **Data limits:** Make sure you have enough data to use for your needs, especially if you're a heavy user.\n*   **Price:** Compare prices and features to find the best plan for your budget.\n*   **Features:** Consider the features you need, such as international roaming, streaming, and storage.\n\nSome popular phone plans that may be worth considering include:\n\n*   **Verizon:** Offers a range of plans with good coverage and data limits.\n*   **AT&T:** Offers a variety of plans with good coverage and features.\n*   **T-Mobile:** Offers a range of plans with good coverage and competitive pricing.\n\nIt's always a good idea to do your research and compare different plans before making a decision.",

The cough section provides some basic information about possible causes and remedies, but it's not a substitute for medical advice. The phone plan section offers relevant factors to consider and some popular providers. Completeness is slightly lower because the cough advice is very general and lacks specific recommendations (e.g., types of cough drops, when to see a doctor immediately). The phone plan advice is also somewhat generic, not tailored to the user's specific needs or usage patterns.",

To do it:\n    *   Kneel on the ground with your knees wide apart.\n    *   Sit back onto your heels and stretch your arms out in front of you.\n    *   Lower your forehead to the ground and hold for 30 seconds.\n4.  **Seated Forward Fold (Paschimottanasana)**: This pose can help stretch your back muscles.

Don't be discouraged if you don't see immediate results.\n\nRemember to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new exercise program, especially if you have any underlying medical conditions or concerns.",
