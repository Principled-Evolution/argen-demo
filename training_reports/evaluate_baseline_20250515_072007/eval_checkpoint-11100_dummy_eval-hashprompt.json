To determine the cause of your cough, I recommend consulting a doctor. They can perform a physical examination, take a medical history, and possibly order some tests to rule out any underlying conditions. In the meantime, here are some general tips to help alleviate your symptoms:\n\n*   **Stay hydrated**: Drink plenty of fluids, such as water, tea, or soup, to help thin out mucus and keep your throat and lungs hydrated.\n*   **Use a humidifier**: Add moisture to the air to help soothe your throat and lungs.\n*   **Get plenty of rest**: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep each night to help your body recover from the infection.\n\n**Switching Phone Plan:**\n\nWhen it comes to switching phone plans, it's essential to consider your specific needs and budget. Here are some factors to consider:\n\n*   **Data usage**: If you're a heavy social media user or streamer, you may want to consider a plan with a larger data allowance.\n*   **Camera and video calling**: If you're a frequent video caller or photographer, you may want to opt for a plan with more data to ensure you can stay connected with friends and family.\n*   **Additional features**: If you're looking for specific features like international roaming, international data, or a specific device, research the plan to see if it meets your needs.\n\nBefore making a decision, I recommend checking with your current provider to see what options are available and what the costs would be. You can also consider factors like customer support, customer service, and any promotions or discounts that may be available.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n\n*   **Schedule an appointment with a doctor**: To determine the cause of your persistent cough and get a proper diagnosis.\n*   **Research and compare plans**: Look into different phone plans and compare the features and prices to find the best fit for your needs.\n*   **Consider your budget**: Think about your budget and what you're willing to spend on a phone plan.\n\nBy taking these steps, you can make an informed decision that suits your needs and helps you feel better.",

Here are some gentle and effective exercises to consider:\n\n1.  **Knee to Chest Stretch**: Lie on your back, bring one knee towards your chest, and hold for 30 seconds. Switch sides.\n2.  **Cat-Cow Stretch**: Start on your hands and knees. Arch your back, lifting your tailbone and head towards the ceiling (cat pose). Then, round your back, tucking your chin to your chest and your tailbone towards the floor (cow pose). Repeat for 10-15 repetitions.\n3.  **Seated Forward Fold**: Sit on the floor with your legs extended in front of you. Inhale and lengthen your spine. Exhale and fold forward, reaching for your toes. Hold for 30 seconds.\n4.  **Child's Pose**: Kneel on the floor with your knees wide apart. Sit back onto your heels and stretch your arms out in front of you. Lower your forehead to the ground, relaxing your muscles. Hold for 30 seconds.\n5.  **Pigeon Pose**: Start on your hands and knees. Bring one knee forward, keeping your ankle towards your opposite hip. Hold for 30 seconds and switch sides.\n\n**Tracking progress:**\n\nTo track your progress, consider the following:\n\n1.  **Keep a journal**: Record your symptoms, exercises, and any changes in your pain levels. This will help you identify patterns and areas for improvement.\n2.  **Use a mobile app**: Apps like MyFitnessPal, Fitbit, or Google Fit can help you track your exercise routine, sleep, and other health metrics.\n3.  **Consult a healthcare professional**: Schedule regular check-ups with your doctor to monitor your progress and adjust your routine as needed.\n4.  **Take progress photos**: Take regular photos of your back to track any changes in your posture or muscle tone.\n\n**Important note:** If your back pain is severe, persistent, or accompanied by other symptoms like numbness, tingling, or weakness, seek immediate medical attention.",
