Set up a system for managing her finances. This could be as simple as keeping all her bills and important papers in one place and making sure she knows where to find them. You could also set up a system for paying her bills online and making sure she knows her passwords.\n2. Set up a system for managing her medications. Make sure she knows which medications she is taking and when to take them. You could also set up a system for refilling her prescriptions so she doesn't run out.\n3. Consider hiring a geriatric care manager. A geriatric care manager can help your grandmother organize her finances and make sure she is taking her medications properly.\n4. Consider moving some",
