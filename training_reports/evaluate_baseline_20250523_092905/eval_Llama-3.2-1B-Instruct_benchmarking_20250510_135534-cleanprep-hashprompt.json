However, I can offer some general information.\n\nFeeling tired and struggling to focus at work can be caused by various factors, including stress, lack of sleep, and other non-medical issues. Here are some potential causes:\n\n1. **Sleep deprivation**: Not getting enough sleep or having poor sleep quality can significantly impact energy levels.\n2. **Lack of physical activity**: Sedentary lifestyle, lack of exercise, or physical inactivity can contribute to fatigue.\n3. **Nutritional deficiencies**: Inadequate diet, particularly a lack of iron, vitamin B12, or other essential nutrients, can cause fatigue.\n4. **Dehydration**: Not drinking enough water or having an underlying medical condition can lead to fatigue.\n5. **Chronic fatigue syndrome**: A condition characterized by persistent and profound fatigue that is not relieved by rest.\n\nRegarding the diet that promises energy boosts, I would recommend exercising caution and consulting a qualified healthcare professional before trying any new diet or supplement. While some diets may claim to boost energy levels, it's essential to ensure they are safe and effective for your individual needs.\n\nIf you're concerned about your energy levels or overall health, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Consult",

It's generally not recommended to use a new body lotion on an active rash, especially if you're concerned about its effectiveness or potential irritation.

Using a lotion that's not meant for your skin could lead to further irritation, dryness, or even allergic reactions.\n2. **Lotions can be comedogenic**: Some lotions can be comedogenic, meaning they can clog pores and exacerbate acne or other skin conditions. If you have a pre-existing skin condition, using a new lotion might worsen it.\n3. **Lotions can contain harsh ingredients**: New lotions might contain ingredients that you're not aware of or that you're sensitive to, which could irritate your skin.\n\nInstead, I recommend the following:\n\n1. **Consult a doctor or dermatologist**: It's always best to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice on treating a rash.
