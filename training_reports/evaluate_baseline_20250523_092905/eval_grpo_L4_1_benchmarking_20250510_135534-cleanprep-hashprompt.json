Use a designated potty area and reward good behavior with treats and praise.\n3. **Socialization**: Introduce your puppy to new people, places, and experiences to help her become confident and well-adjusted.\n4. **Positive reinforcement training**: Reward desired behaviors with treats, praise, and affection to encourage good behavior.\n5. **Be consistent**: Set clear boundaries and rules, and stick to them.\n\nRegarding your cough, it's possible that it's related to your puppy's respiratory system. If you're experiencing:\n\n* Persistent coughing or wheezing\n* Difficulty breathing\n* Chest pain or tightness\n* Fever\n* Coughing up mucus or blood\n\nConsult a veterinarian to rule out any underlying health issues.

Suggest that your dad try to avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime.\n4. **Create a sleep-conducive environment**: Make sure the bedroom is dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature. Consider using earplugs, blackout curtains, or a white noise machine if necessary.\n5. **Encourage physical activity**: Regular exercise can help reduce stress and improve sleep quality.

This can help slow down your heart rate and calm your mind.\n2. **Visualization**: Close your eyes and imagine yourself acing the interview. Visualize yourself answering questions confidently and receiving positive feedback.\n3. **Positive self-talk**: Remind yourself of your strengths and qualifications. Repeat positive affirmations to boost your confidence.\n4. **Physical relaxation techniques**: Engage in some light physical activity, like a short walk or some stretching exercises, to release tension.\n5. **Get a good night's sleep**: Aim for 7-8 hours of sleep to ensure you're well-rested and alert for the interview.\n\nRegarding your hairstyle, it's not necessary to change it for a job interview. However, if you're concerned about making a good impression, consider keeping your hair simple and neat. Avoid bold or distracting styles that might draw attention away from your qualifications and personality.\n\nIf you're still feeling anxious, consider consulting with a trusted friend or family member for support. They can offer valuable advice and help you feel more at",

A lower brightness and higher contrast can help reduce eye strain.\n3.  **Blink regularly**: Make a conscious effort to blink while working on your computer. This helps to keep your eyes moist and reduces the risk of dryness.\n4.  **Take breaks**: Take regular breaks (every 30-60 minutes) to stretch, move around, and rest your eyes.\n5.  **Consider eye exercises**: Try rolling your eyes, focusing on a point and then shifting your gaze to another point, or doing simple eye stretches.\n\nIf your headaches persist or worsen, consult an eye care professional for personalized advice.",
