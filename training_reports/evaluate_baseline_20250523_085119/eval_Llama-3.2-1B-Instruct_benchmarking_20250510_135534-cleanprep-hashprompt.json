Keep the area clean and dry.\n2. Apply a topical cream or ointment to soothe the skin.\n3. Avoid scratching the affected area, as this can lead to further irritation and potentially introduce bacteria into the skin.\n\nHowever, please do not attempt to treat the rash yourself or delay seeking medical attention.
