Ask open-ended questions like \"Hey, I've noticed you've lost a lot of weight lately. Is everything okay?\" or \"I'm worried about your health. Is there something going on that's causing you to make changes to your diet or exercise routine?\"\n\nIf you're concerned about your friend's health, it's always best to consult a qualified healthcare professional for personalized advice.
