These services can provide immediate support and connect him with local resources.\n3. **Offer to help with budgeting and financial planning**: Assist your brother in creating a budget, prioritizing expenses, and exploring ways to reduce debt. You can also help him research local non-profit organizations that offer financial counseling or assistance programs.\n4. **Encourage self-care**: Suggest healthy coping mechanisms, such as exercise, meditation, or creative activities, to help",

Since you mentioned allergies, it's possible that your sneezing might be related to an allergic reaction to the puppy's dander, saliva, or other allergens.

They may also recommend allergy testing or other diagnostic tests to help identify the underlying issue.\n\nIn the meantime, here are some general tips to help soothe your puppy's sneezing:\n\n* Provide plenty of fresh air and ventilation in the house\n* Use HEPA air purifiers to reduce allergens\n* Keep your puppy away from strong-smelling foods or substances\n* Use a humidifier to add moisture to the air\n* Consider using a saline drops or spray to help loosen and clear out mucus\n\nRemember, it's always better to err on the side of caution and consult a veterinarian to ensure your puppy's health and",
