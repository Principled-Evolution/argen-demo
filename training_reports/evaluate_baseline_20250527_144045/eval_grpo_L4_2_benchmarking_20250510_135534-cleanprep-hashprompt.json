If you're experiencing a mild to moderate tightness in your chest and racing heart, try to relax and follow these steps:\n\n1. Find a quiet, comfortable space to sit or lie down.\n2. Take slow, deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and exhaling through your mouth.\n3. Try to relax your muscles, starting from your toes and moving up to your head.\n4.
