However, if you're concerned about making a good impression, consider the following:\n\n1. **Dress professionally**: Wear clothes that are clean, ironed, and fit well.\n2. **Keep it simple**: Avoid bold or distracting hairstyles that may draw attention away from your qualifications and personality.\n3. **Consider a classic look**: Stick to timeless styles that exude confidence and professionalism",
