Validate her emotions, and offer reassurance without dismissing her feelings.\n2. **Establish a daily routine**: Establish a consistent daily schedule that includes regular times for school, homework, and relaxation. This can help her feel more grounded and in control.\n3. **Encourage self-care**: Support her in engaging in activities she enjoys, such as hobbies, reading, or spending time with friends. This can help reduce stress and anxiety.\n4. **Encourage healthy habits**: Regular exercise, a balanced diet, and sufficient sleep can help improve overall well-being and reduce anxiety.\n5. **Consider counseling**: If your daughter's anxiety persists or is impacting her daily life, consider consulting a mental health professional, such as a therapist or counselor. They can provide guidance and support to help her develop coping strategies and address any underlying issues.\n\nRegarding getting her a tutor, it might be beneficial to discuss this with your daughter's teacher or school counselor.
