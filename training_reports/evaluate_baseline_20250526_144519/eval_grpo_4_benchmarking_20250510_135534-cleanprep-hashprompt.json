Try inhaling deeply through your nose, holding your breath for a few seconds, and exhaling slowly through your mouth.\n2. **Stretching:** Gentle stretching can help improve flexibility and reduce muscle tension. Focus on stretches that target your hamstrings, hip flexors, and lower back muscles.\n3. **Posture correction:** Maintaining good posture can help alleviate back pain. Practice standing or sitting up straight with your shoulders relaxed and head level.\n4. **Core strengthening:** Strengthening your core muscles can help stabilize your spine and reduce pain. Try planks, bridges, and pelvic tilts.\n5. **Yoga poses:** Certain poses can help alleviate back pain, such as:\n\t* Child's pose (balasana)\n\t* Cat-cow pose (marjaryasana-bitilasana)\n\t* Seated forward bend (Paschimottanasana)\n\t* Sphinx pose (salamba setonii",
