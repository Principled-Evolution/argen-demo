Then, round your back, tucking your chin to your chest and your tailbone towards the ground (like a cow). Repeat for 10-15 repetitions.\n4. **Child's pose**: Kneel on the ground with your knees wide apart. Sit back onto your heels and stretch your arms out in front of you, lowering your forehead to the ground. Hold for 5-10 breaths.\n5. **Bridge**: Lie on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the ground. Slowly lift your hips towards the ceiling, squeezing your glutes and lower back muscles.

Certain medications\n\nIf you're still unsure or if your mom's symptoms persist, it's a good idea to schedule an appointment with her doctor. They can:\n\n1. Conduct a thorough physical examination\n2. Run some basic tests (e.g., blood work, imaging studies)\n3. Discuss potential underlying conditions\n4.

Praise and reward successful attempts.\n3. **Basic obedience commands**: Teach basic commands like \"sit,\" \"stay,\" \"come,\" and \"leave it.\" Use positive reinforcement techniques like treats and praise.\n4. **Socialization**: Introduce your puppy to new people, places, and experiences to help her develop social skills and confidence.\n5. **Be patient**: Training a puppy takes time, and accidents will happen. Don't scold or punish, as this can create anxiety and make the training process more challenging.\n\nRegarding your cough, it's understandable to be concerned.

However, if you're experiencing severe or persistent sleep disturbances, I recommend consulting a healthcare professional for personalized guidance.\n\nFor sleep, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Establish a bedtime routine**: Develop a calming pre-sleep routine, such as reading, meditation, or a warm bath, to signal your body that it's time to sleep.\n2. **Stick to a sleep schedule**: Go to bed and wake up at the same time every day, including weekends, to regulate your body's internal clock.\n3. **Create a sleep-conducive environment**: Make your bedroom a sleep haven by ensuring it's dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature.\n4. **Avoid screens before bedtime**: The blue light emitted from screens can suppress melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep.\n5. **Exercise regularly**: Regular physical activity can help improve sleep quality, but avoid vigorous exercise within a few hours of bedtime.\n6. **Limit caffeine and nicotine**: Both can disrupt sleep patterns and make it harder to fall asleep.\n7. **Try relaxation techniques**: Techniques like deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, or mindfulness meditation can help calm your mind and body before sleep.\n\nRegarding cravings, it's essential to address the underlying causes",
