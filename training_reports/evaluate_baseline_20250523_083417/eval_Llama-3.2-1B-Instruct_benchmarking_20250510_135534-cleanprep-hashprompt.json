Avoid punishment or negative reinforcement, as it can create anxiety and fear.\n3. **Housebreaking**: Establish a designated potty area and take your puppy outside frequently, especially after meals and naps. Praise and reward her when she goes potty in the right spot.\n4. **Socialization**: Introduce your puppy to new people, places, and experiences to help her develop social skills and confidence.\n5. **Be patient**: Puppies have short attention spans, so be prepared for accidents and setbacks. Don't scold or punish your puppy for mistakes – it can create anxiety and make training more challenging.\n\nRegarding your cough, it's possible that it's related to your puppy's respiratory system, but it's also possible that it's a coincidence.

Early diagnosis and treatment can help prevent complications and improve outcomes.\n\nIf your son is experiencing:\n\n* Severe symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe coughing\n* Fever over 102°F (39°C)\n* Blood in sputum or mucus\n* Worsening symptoms over time\n* Difficulty swallowing or speaking\n* Severe headache or confusion\n\nYou should seek medical attention immediately.\n\nHowever, if your son's symptoms are mild, such as a mild cough and wheezing, it's likely that a visit to the doctor can wait until tomorrow. But it's always better to err on the side of caution and consult a doctor if you're unsure.",
