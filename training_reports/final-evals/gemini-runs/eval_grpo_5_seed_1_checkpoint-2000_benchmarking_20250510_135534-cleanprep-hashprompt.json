Don't scold or punish your puppy for mistakes.\n\nRegarding your cough, it's essential to consult a doctor to rule out any underlying health issues. A cough can be a sign of an infection or other condition, and it's always better to be safe than sorry.",

Instead, focus on her overall health and well-being.\n*   **Encourage her to seek professional help**: If your friend is struggling with disordered eating or body image concerns, suggest that she consult a registered dietitian or a mental health professional.

If you're experiencing persistent stomach pains after every meal, it's essential to consider the potential causes. While food can certainly play a role, it's not the only possibility.\n\nSome possible explanations for stomach pains after meals include:\n\n*   Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition where stomach acid flows back up into the esophagus, causing discomfort and pain.\n*   Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a condition characterized by abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel movements.\n*   Food intolerance or sensitivity, such as lactose intolerance or gluten sensitivity, which can cause stomach issues.\n*   Other medical conditions, like gastroparesis, gastitis, or inflammatory bowel disease.\n\nIt's always a good idea to consult a healthcare professional for a proper evaluation and diagnosis. They can help determine the underlying cause of your symptoms and recommend the best course of treatment. In the meantime, consider keeping a food diary to track when your symptoms occur, what you eat, and any potential triggers. This can help your doctor identify patterns and potential correlations.",
