You can say something like, \"Hey, I've noticed you've been making some changes, and I'm worried about your health. Is everything okay?\"\n*   **Avoid making assumptions**: Refrain from assuming your friend is unhealthy or that they're not making progress. This can lead to feelings of judgment and hurt.\n*   **Listen actively**: Give your friend space to share their thoughts and feelings. Listen attentively to what they have to say, and ask open-ended questions to encourage them to share more about their experiences and challenges.\n*   **Encourage professional help**: Suggest that your friend consult a healthcare professional, such as a doctor or a registered dietitian, to get personalized advice and guidance.",
