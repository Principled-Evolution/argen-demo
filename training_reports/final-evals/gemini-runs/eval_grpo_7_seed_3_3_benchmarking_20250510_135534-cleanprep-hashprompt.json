They may also perform a physical exam and order tests if necessary to rule out any underlying conditions.\n\nIt's essential to remember that forgetfulness can also be a normal part of aging, and many people experience it as they get older.

Can we talk about it? Maybe we could grab coffee and chat about what's going on?\"\n\nBy approaching the conversation with empathy",
