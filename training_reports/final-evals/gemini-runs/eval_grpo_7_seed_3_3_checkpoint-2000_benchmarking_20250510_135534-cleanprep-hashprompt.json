Suggest activities he enjoys, like walking, jogging, or any other exercise that he's been wanting to try.\n3. **Create a sleep-conducive environment**: Make his bedroom a sleep haven by ensuring it's dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature. Consider using earplugs, blackout curtains, or a white noise machine if necessary.\n4. **Limit exposure to screens before bedtime**: The blue light from smartphones, tablets, or computers can suppress melatonin production, making it harder to fall asleep. Encourage him to avoid screens for at least an hour before bedtime.\n5",
