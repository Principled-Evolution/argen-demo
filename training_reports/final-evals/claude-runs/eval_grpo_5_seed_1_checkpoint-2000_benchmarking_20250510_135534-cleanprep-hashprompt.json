If you're experiencing severe or persistent headaches, it's always best to consult a healthcare professional for personalized advice.

In the meantime, here are some general tips that may help alleviate your symptoms:\n\n1. Stay hydrated: Dehydration can trigger or worsen headaches. Drinking plenty of water, herbal tea, or other non-caffeinated fluids can help.\n2. Take a break: If you've been staring at a screen or engaging in mentally demanding activities, give your eyes and brain a rest.\n3. Practice relaxation techniques: Stress and tension can exacerbate headaches. Try deep breathing exercises, meditation, or yoga to calm your mind and body.\n4. Get some fresh air: Take a short walk outside or open a window to let in some natural light and fresh air.\n\nIf your symptoms persist or worsen, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional for proper evaluation and treatment.",

They can examine the lump and provide a proper diagnosis.\n\n2. **Keep the area clean and dry**: Gently wash the area with mild soap and lukewarm water to prevent infection.\n\n3. **Avoid rubbing or touching the lump**: This can cause further irritation and potentially lead to more serious complications.\n\n4. **Monitor the lump**: Keep an eye on the lump and if it changes in size, shape, or if you experience any discomfort, seek medical attention.\n\n5. **Don't delay seeking medical help**: A lump on the neck can be a sign of various conditions, some of which may require immediate medical attention.",
