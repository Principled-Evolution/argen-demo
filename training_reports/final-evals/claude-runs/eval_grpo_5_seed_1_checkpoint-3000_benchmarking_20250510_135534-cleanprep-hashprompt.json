Suggest that your dad engage in some light physical activity, like a short walk or some stretching exercises, to help clear his mind.\n4. **Listen and validate his feelings**: Sometimes, all your dad needs is someone to listen to him without judgment. Let him know that you're there to support him and that his feelings are valid.\n5. **Encourage social connections**: Suggest that your dad connect with friends, family, or a support group to talk about his stress and anxiety.
