To determine the cause, a doctor will typically perform a physical examination, take a medical history, and possibly order imaging tests (e.g., ultrasound, MRI, or CT scans) to get a better look at the lump.\n\nGiven your upcoming project, it might be helpful to take some time to relax and focus on your well-being.
