This is because some conditions, such as asthma, bronchiolitis, or pneumonia, can be more severe in children and require prompt medical attention.\n\nYour pediatrician can evaluate your son's overall health, perform a physical examination, and run some tests to determine the cause of his symptoms. They can also provide guidance on the best course of treatment and offer advice on how to manage his symptoms until you can get him seen by a healthcare professional.\n\nIf your son is experiencing difficulty breathing, chest pain, or severe symptoms, such as high fever, vomiting, or severe headache, seek emergency medical attention immediately.",
