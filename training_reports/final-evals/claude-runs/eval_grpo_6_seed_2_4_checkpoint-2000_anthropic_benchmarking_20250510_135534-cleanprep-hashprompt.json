Instead, clean up the mess and try to prevent it from happening again.\n\nRegarding your cough, it's possible that it could be related to your puppy's health.

Listen attentively and empathetically, and avoid giving unsolicited advice.\n\nExample: \"Hey, I've noticed you've been really active lately, and I'm worried about your health. Is everything okay?
