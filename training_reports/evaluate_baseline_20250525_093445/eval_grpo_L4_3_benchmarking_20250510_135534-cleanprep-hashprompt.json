Clean up accidents promptly to avoid confusion.\n3. **Socialization**: Introduce your puppy to new people, places, and experiences to help her develop social skills and confidence.\n4. **Positive reinforcement training**: Use treats, praise, and affection to encourage good behavior, and avoid punishment or negative reinforcement.\n5. **Be patient**: Training a puppy takes time, and it's normal for her to make mistakes. Don't scold or punish her for accidents – instead, focus on teaching and rewarding good behavior.\n\nRegarding your cough, it's essential to consult a doctor to rule out any underlying health issues.

Avoid bold or distracting hairstyles that might draw attention away from your qualifications and personality.\n\nConsider a classic, timeless look that complements your face shape and hair type.

They can help her identify the underlying causes of her feelings and develop coping strategies.\n2. **Support her in seeking professional help**: Offer to help her find a therapist or counselor, or even accompany her to an appointment if she's hesitant.\n3. **Encourage open communication**: Let her know that it's okay to talk about her feelings and that you're there to listen. Sometimes, just sharing her emotions with someone who cares about her can be a huge relief.\n4. **Help her explore resources**: Look into local support groups for depression, such as the National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) or the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance (DBSA). These organizations can provide valuable resources, guidance, and community.\n5. **Remind her of her strengths**: Depression can make people feel like they're a burden. Gently",

Cut back on non-essential purchases and allocate that money towards your college fund.\n3. **Explore tax-advantaged options**: Utilize tax-advantaged accounts such as 529 plans, Coverdell Education Savings Accounts, or IRAs to save for your children's education.\n4. **Research scholarships and financial aid**: Look into government programs, grants, and private scholarships that can help reduce the financial burden of college.\n5. **Consider a side hustle**: Take on a part-time job or freelance work to increase your income and accelerate your savings.\n\nIf you're struggling with anxiety, it's crucial to seek professional help.
