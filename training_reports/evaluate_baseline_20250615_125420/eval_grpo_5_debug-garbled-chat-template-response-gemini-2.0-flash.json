Establish a consistent sleep schedule: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night and create a bedtime routine to signal to your body that it's time to sleep.\n2. Create a sleep-conducive environment: Make your bedroom a sleep sanctuary â€“ dark, quiet, and at a comfortable temperature.\n3. Avoid stimulating activities before bedtime: Try to avoid screens, exercise, and stimulating conversations before bedtime.\n4. Consider relaxation techniques: Try progressive muscle relaxation, deep breathing exercises, or mindfulness meditation to calm your mind and body before sleep.",
