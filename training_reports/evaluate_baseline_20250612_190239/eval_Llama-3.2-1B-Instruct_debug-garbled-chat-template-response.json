However, using bright lights too close to bedtime can suppress melatonin production.\n3. **Color temperature can also be affected by the color of the bulb**: Some bulbs with a color temperature around 3500K-4000K can also be used in bedrooms, as they can help promote relaxation.\n\nFor a bedroom, it's generally recommended to use:\n\n* **Dimmable LED bulbs**",

Keep detailed records of your communication with the hospital and insurance provider.\r\n5. **Consider seeking medical record review**: If you're not satisfied with the hospital's response, you may want to request a copy of your medical records to review.
