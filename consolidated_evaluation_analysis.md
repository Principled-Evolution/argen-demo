## Median Seed Analysis

### Median Seed: Seed 3 (GRPO7)
- **Peak Score**: 0.7825 (checkpoint-3000)
- **Rank**: 2nd out of 3 seeds
- **Selection Rationale**: Middle performance among three seeds ensures fair ablation comparisons

#### Seed Performance Ranking
| Rank | Seed | Peak Score | Best Checkpoint | Model Type |
|------|------|------------|-----------------|------------|
| 1 | Seed 2 | **0.7947** | final | GRPO6 |
| 2 | **Seed 3** | **0.7825** | 3000 | **GRPO7** ‚Üê **MEDIAN** |
| 3 | Seed 1 | 0.7752 | 3000 | GRPO5 |

#### Why Seed 3 for Ablations?
1. **Scientific Rigor**: Avoids cherry-picking the best seed (Seed 2)
2. **Representative Performance**: Middle-ranking seed represents typical performance
3. **Fair Comparisons**: Ablation studies will use a representative, not exceptional, baseline

| 11 | GRPO5 | 1 | 1000 | 0.7440 | -0.0507 |

### Key Observations
1. **Seed 2 Dominance**: Best overall model, but limited checkpoint data
2. **Seed 3 Consistency**: Multiple high-performing checkpoints
3. **Seed 1 Progression**: Clear improvement from checkpoint 1000 to 3000
4. **Training Dynamics**: Peak performance often at intermediate checkpoints (3000)

## Recommendations

### For Publication/Results Tables
1. **Use Champion Model (GRPO6 Seed 2)** for main results tables showing peak performance
2. **Use Helpful-Champion Model (GRPO7 Seed 3 checkpoint-1000)** for helpfulness-focused comparisons
3. **Report 0.7947 combined score** as peak ArGen performance
4. **Report 0.5947 helpfulness score** as best helpfulness preservation (-0.1% vs baseline)
5. **Highlight 25% improvement** over Llama-3.2-1B baseline
6. **Emphasize dharma improvements** (70.9% score increase, 88.2% violation reduction)

### For Ablation Studies
1. **Use Median Seed (Seed 3)** for all ablation experiments
2. **Start from checkpoint-3000** (peak performance for Seed 3: 0.7825)
3. **Run reward-only and policy-only ablations** from this checkpoint
4. **Document methodology** to demonstrate scientific rigor

### Next Steps
1. **Execute ablation studies** using Seed 3 checkpoint-3000
2. **Prepare publication tables** with Champion Model results
3. **Document training procedures** for reproducibility
4. **Consider additional seeds** if more statistical power needed
