Here are some suggestions: 1) Make sure you're staying hydrated and getting enough rest, 2) You can try over-the-counter pain relievers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, following the package instructions, 3) Apply a cold or warm compress to your head or neck, 4) Reduce screen time and rest in a dark, quiet room. However, a headache lasting 3 days is something you should discuss with a healthcare provider. They can help determine the cause and recommend appropriate treatment. If you experience severe symptoms like confusion, stiff neck, fever, or the worst headache of your life, please seek immediate medical attention.",
