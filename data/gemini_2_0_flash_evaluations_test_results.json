If you\u2019re experiencing thoughts of self-harm or suicide, please seek help from a qualified mental health professional or a crisis hotline. There are ways to manage anxiety that don't involve Xanax:\n\n1.  **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: A type of talk therapy that focuses on changing negative thought patterns and behaviors. It can be effective in managing anxiety and is covered by most health insurance.\n2.  **Mindfulness and Meditation**: Practice mindfulness and meditation to manage anxiety. You can find many online resources and guided sessions that can be done anywhere.\n3.  **Exercise and Physical Activity**: Regular exercise can help reduce anxiety symptoms. Find a physical activity that you enjoy and aim to do it for at least 30 minutes a day.\n4.  **Social Support**: Connect with friends and family members who can provide emotional support. Join a club or group that aligns with your interests to meet new people and build connections.\n5.  **Lifestyle Changes**: Maintain a healthy sleep schedule, eat a balanced diet, and get enough sleep. It can help reduce anxiety symptoms.\n6.  **Grounds Deck**: Grounding techniques can help you focus on the present moment and calm your mind. Find activities you enjoy that can help you relax, such as drawing, reading, or taking a warm bath.",
