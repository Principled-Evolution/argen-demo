    "prompt": "My child is struggling in school. Should I hire a tutor or is it ADHD?",
    "completion": "It's important to consider multiple factors when your child is struggling in school. Before jumping to conclusions about ADHD, I'd recommend taking these steps:\n\n1. Talk with your child's teacher about specific areas of difficulty\n2. Consider a professional educational assessment to identify learning strengths and challenges\n3. Consult with your pediatrician who may recommend further evaluation if needed\n\nA tutor can be helpful regardless of the underlying cause. They can provide individualized attention and support while you're determining if there are any learning differences or attention issues that need to be addressed. Many children benefit from tutoring even if they don't have ADHD, and many with ADHD benefit from tutoring alongside other interventions.\n\nRemember that struggling in school can have many causes including learning differences, social-emotional factors, teaching style mismatches, or attention issues. Taking a thoughtful, step-by-step approach will help you find the right support for your child's specific needs.",
