However, mild symptoms might not necessarily warrant a complete elimination of gluten from her diet just yet.\n\nOther sources suggest that a very strict gluten-free diet might not be necessary for gluten sensitivity in kids, especially if it\'s mild and doesn\'t interfere with daily activities. Sometimes, some people might not react to gluten at all, or their symptoms might be mild enough that eliminating it altogether isn\'t necessary.\n\nConsidering your child\'s friends are going to a pizza party, I\'d recommend a few possibilities:\n\n1. **A gluten-free pizza option**: Pizza chains like Domino\'s, Pizza Hut, or Papa John\'s often have gluten-free crusts or can make gluten-free pizzas for customers with dietary restrictions. Your daughter might be able to enjoy a bit of pizza without worrying about it being too "gluten-y."\n2. **Explore pizza shops with gluten-free options**: If your daughter is really set on having a slice of pizza, she might consider finding pizza shops in your area that offer gluten-free cheese or crusts, or even just offering a gluten-free topping option.\n3. **Order pizza from a reputable gluten-free restaurant**: If you want to make it a special treat, your daughter could consider ordering pizza from a restaurant with a dedicated gluten-free menu. This way, she can enjoy the party without worrying about gluten.\n\nBefore making a decision, I strongly recommend consulting with your pediatrician to discuss your daughter\'s concerns and any potential risks associated with consuming gluten. They can provide guidance based on her specific needs and medical history.\n\nUltimately, the decision is yours to make as a parent, but being proactive and open with your daughter about her concerns and listening to your pediatrician\'s advice will help her feel more comfortable and confident about her choices.'}], [{'role': 'assistant', 'content': "For kids, food sensitivities can be tricky, especially during social gatherings. If your daughter is genuinely experiencing stomach aches after eating gluten, it's best to err on the side of caution and keep her pizza night a no-go.\n\nHere's why: while some people might be able to tolerate small amounts of gluten, it's not necessarily a one-size-fits-all situation. If your daughter is experiencing persistent or severe digestive issues, she might need to avoid gluten altogether to prevent any potential worsening of symptoms.\n\nThink of it this way: your daughter's body is like a computer, and gluten is like a file that might clog up or cause problems. Just as you wouldn't introduce malware to your computer without first checking for viruses, it's crucial to be careful with food sensitivities.\n\nInstead of going to the pizza party, consider suggesting a different activity with her friends that doesn't require her to eat gluten. This might be something like going for a bike ride, playing a game, or even just hanging out at home together.\n\nIt's always better to prioritize your daughter's health and safety over social gatherings, especially if they involve food. You can explain to her that it's okay to set boundaries and take care of her own needs, and that she's not alone."}]]
