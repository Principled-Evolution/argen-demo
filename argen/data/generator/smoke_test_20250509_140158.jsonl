That's a good start. Lower back pain can be a real nuisance, especially if you have to sit for a long time. But whether it's serious depends on a few factors, like how long you've been experiencing it and how it's affecting your daily life.\n\nFirst, let's try to identify some potential causes. Have you noticed any triggers, like bending or lifting, that might be exacerbating the pain? Or is it more of a constant ache?\n\nAlso, have you recently done anything strenuous or physically demanding? Sometimes, sudden changes in your routine can lead to muscle strain. And if you've had any recent injuries or illnesses, it's possible that you might be experiencing some kind of inflammatory response.\n\nI'd like to ask a few more questions to help us narrow down the possibilities. Can you tell me more about your work project and what you're trying to accomplish? And how long have you been experiencing the pain? Was it sudden or did it come on gradually?\n\n(Note: I'll provide some potential next steps and ask follow-up questions based on your responses. Let's work through this together!)", "tier": "B"}
