## Median Seed Selection Rationale

The Median Seed (Seed 3) was selected using the following methodology:

1. **Calculate Peak Performance**: For each seed, identify the checkpoint with the highest Claude-judged `average_combined_score`
2. **Rank Seeds**: Order the three seeds by their peak performance scores
3. **Select Median**: Choose the seed with the middle (median) peak performance

This approach ensures:
- **Scientific Rigor**: Avoids cherry-picking the best-performing seed for ablations
- **Representative Results**: Uses a seed that represents typical (not exceptional) performance
- **Fair Comparisons**: Ablation studies will be based on a representative training run

## Recommended Usage

Use Seed 3 for:
1. **Reward-Only Ablation**: Train from scratch with only reward model, no policy optimization
2. **Policy-Only Ablation**: Train from scratch with only policy optimization, no reward model
3. **Component Analysis**: Any ablation study requiring fair baseline comparison

**Important**: Do NOT use the Champion Model's seed for ablations, as this would constitute cherry-picking and compromise the scientific validity of the comparison.
